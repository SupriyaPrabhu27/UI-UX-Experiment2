# UI-UX-Experiment2

## Aim:To design basic mobile and web layouts for an existing case study by applying Gestalt principles, UI design patterns, interaction behaviors, usability principles, and integrating a brand logo created using Canva.

## Algorithm:
1.Study the existing case study and identify layout requirements.

2.Apply Gestalt principles (proximity, similarity, alignment, continuity) to structure the layout.

3.Incorporate UI components such as headers, cards, navigation bars, and grids.

4.Define interaction behaviors like feedback, navigation cues, and accessibility options.

5.Add the brand logo and maintain consistent visual styling across layouts.

6.Build the final mobile and web layout using structured HTML.
